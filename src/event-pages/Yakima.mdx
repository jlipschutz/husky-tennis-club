# Yakima Tournament
###### Yakima, WA
*1/31/2019 - 2/2/2019*

---

We will be going back to Yakima this year. Gonzaga is hosting and we will see a variety of teams at the tournament.

**Date:**

The Yakima tournament will be held February 2nd/3rd.

Tournament matchplay is currently scheduled from Saturday to Sunday, so while we would leave Friday you wouldn't need to miss any class.

**General:**

We do not have a specific location yet, but will send it out later. Additionally, the price of the tournament will usually be lower than others so expect something around $90 or so (This is very likely to change as we look at hotel costs and everything else).

Due to Yakima and the University of Victoria Invitational tournaments being back to back, we will also be considering if you went to Victoria in tryouts for Yakima (along with overall interest in the tournament). I expect us to bring 2 teams but if interest is high enough we might bring 3. Thanks!

There are two forms for signing up. One for University of Victoria and one for Yakima. These forms are due on Friday at 11:59pm!
