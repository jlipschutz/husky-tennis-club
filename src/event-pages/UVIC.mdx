# University of Victoria Invitational
###### Victoria, British Columbia
*1/25/2020 - 1/28/2019*

---

We will be traveling to Canada which means you will need some form of official documentation to get into and out of Canada. This is usually a passport but a enhanced driver's licence can be used. Let us know if you have any questions on this topic so we can solve it before leaving. We plan on taking 3 teams, this means that there are spots for 12 guys and 12 girls. We will need 4-6 drivers for this tournament.

**Date:**

The tournament takes place from the January 25th (5PM-11PM) to January 26th (9AM-5PM).

**Location:**

It will be at Oak Bay Recreation Centre (1975 Bee Street, Victoria BC, V8R 5E6).

**Leaving Times:**

Since we are playing at 5PM this means that we will have to leave early for the tournament (This will be around 11AM to get there at 5PM since we have to catch the 2PM ferry). We will be able to mix up teams so you might be able to leave later in the day as some teams will not play exactly at 5PM but rather later that day. For everyone especially drivers, I will need to know the earliest you can leave so we can sort out who will leave when. This is more important than the previous tournaments since we usually do not have matches on the Friday we leave.

**Price:**

This tournament will be more than the standard $100 cause the ferry to Victoria is insanely expensive. Expect somewhere around $135 (this is still subject to change).

If you are interested in going, please respond to this email with your Name, Student ID, whether or not you can drive and when you will be able to leave campus. As always, if you have a car you will be prioritized over other members. Thanks!
