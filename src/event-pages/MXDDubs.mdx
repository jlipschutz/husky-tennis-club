# Mixed Doubles BBQ
###### University of Washington
*5/28/2019*

---

This year's BBQ will be held at the IMA South Courts, otherwise known as the Bill Quillian Tennis Stadium (where we practice). We have courts reserved for June 2nd, 11AM - 6PM, so we have plenty of time to get a lot of good tennis and food in! Signups will be free for members of the club and cost $10 for non-members. Everyone will be required to bring one food or utensil to the event. There will be two forms to fill out, one for the tournament signup and the other for food signup. Both will be at the bottom of the email. There will also be a Facebook event so be on the lookout for that!

Like previous years we will have prizes for at least the winning team and most likely the team that places second additionally! I am unsure what they will be but I will have it sorted out by the BBQ. Additionally, we will have a Facebook event page, so be on the lookout for that.

The form will be due by 11:59pm on Sunday, May 19th.
